Collatz resistor tools

This project explores the behavior of extremely large numbers under the Collatz conjecture. 
It includes Python scripts for high-volume experimentation and a shell script to automate the execution 
and management of multiple instances in parallel.

- coco.py  
  The main script. It repeatedly generates large random numbers and applies Collatz steps to each. 
  If a number fails to drop below a defined lower bound after a set number of steps, it is considered "interesting" and logged in a file.

- test_solution.py  
  A test script for analyzing the Collatz behavior of a specific large number. Itâ€™s useful for isolating slow-to-collapse values 
  and checking if any values fall into a cycle or unexpected state.

- coco.sh
  A shell script containing helper functions for:
  - Launching multiple instances of `coco.py` in the background with delays between them
  - Killing all running instances of `coco.py`

- possible_solutions  
  This file is automatically generated by `coco.py` when a number surpasses the defined step threshold without reducing below the lower bound. 
  It is overwritten or appended depending on how the script is triggered.  


To run the main experiment:

- python coco.py

To test a specific number:

- python test_solution.py

Launch multiple background processes using the shell script:

- source coco.sh

- coco 5    # Launch 5 background processes

Kill all coco.py processes

- cocon
